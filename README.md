# Dansdata API

Open API for retrieving information about social dances in Sweden.

## Getting Started

_The project makes use of VSCode's [devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to create a basic, common development environment. The following instructions assume you are using this environment. If you do not want to use a devcontainer, necessary steps to configure your local environment can be deduced from files in the [`.devcontainer`](./.devcontainer) directory._

To run the API locally

```
$ npm run dev
```
